annoying:
- https://cybertemp.xyz - wonderful domain selection but PoW captcha

weird state management (livewire):
- https://priyo.email - nice domain selection
- https://edumailfree.com - .edu.xx domains
- https://tempmail.tel - mid selection (~30)
- https://mnx-family.com - mid selection (~30)
- https://www.6d6f.com - mid selection (~25)

not enough (public?) domains:
- https://mail.gw & https://mail.tm - not enough domains, but easy API
